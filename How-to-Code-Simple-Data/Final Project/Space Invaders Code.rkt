Now that you've taken some time to think about the problem and complete a domain analysis,
open the starter file and read through it. We have provided constants and data definitions,
but no other parts of the program. 

Work through your design of Space Invaders following the recipe closely.
If you get stuck, go back through the recipe steps and make sure that there is correspondence
between your signature and purpose, you are using the correct template, you have the correct
number of parameters, etc. If you are still having trouble, you can discuss ways to approach
the problem with your peers on the discussion board.

Here is a video of what the gameplay of our version of Space Invaders looks like.
Your game should have the same functionality, but feel free to get creative with the graphics.
