You have now seen that because of the way the ListOfNumber type comment uses a base case, a cons and a self-reference it can represent arbitrary sized data. The type comment also leads to a template with a natural recursion. That template has 3 positions we can fill in, the base-case result, the contribution of the first and the combination. What the table suggests is that a given function might be specified from the type comment and the value that fills the positions alone.  Can you imagine programming that way?
