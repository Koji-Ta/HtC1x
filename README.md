The MOOC courses by UBC are recommended by OSSU under the core programming section.

However these courses were recently put behind a paywall. All questions can no longer be accessed, which makes learning the material close to impossible.

I was able to find this directory containing the questions from an older course on a different website. I believe that they should line up with the material on edX.

In addition, the course is based on the book "How to Design Programs, Second Edition" which is freely availible on the web at htdp.org

This directory also contains exercises and solutions from a slightly older release of the book.

The primary objective is to reorganize the UBC folder to match the question numbers in current courses on edX "How to Code: Simple Data"; update the HTDP folder to match current exercise numbers; recommend exercises to match any missing HtC questions; and to clean up in general.

Secondary objectives is to make a directory of the youtube videos since they are unlisted, and to make the HTDP exercise answers compliant to the UBC course specifications.

Note that the course will be archived after April 2019. I am not sure what will happen to the paywalled material. Hopefully they will be released making my job much easier.

I am going through the course and will update each module as I complete them.

Author note: I am very new to github, so any advice, hints, tricks or help in general is greatly appreciated!
